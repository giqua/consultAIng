# ConsultAIng: Analysis and Next Steps

## Current State
- Basic Slack bot responding to messages
- Simple query processing using OpenAI's API
- Basic GitHub operations implemented (cloning, listing branches, creating branches)

## Goals
- Implement code review functionality
- Implement code generation functionality
- Provide context-aware responses

## Completed Items
- Implemented basic GitHub operations
- Cloning repositories
- Listing branches
- Creating new branches

## Considerations

### Context
- How to define "context"? (project-specific, language-specific, user-specific)
- Context storage and management strategy
- Frequency of context updates

### Code Review
- Focus areas: style, performance, security, etc.
- Method for code submission (considering Slack's message size limits)
- Desired level of review detail

### Code Generation
- Scope of generation: snippets, functions, entire files
- Ensuring alignment with project style and standards
- Handling multiple programming languages

### Integration
- Potential integration with version control systems
- Consideration of other development tool integrations

### Security and Privacy
- Ensuring security of shared code
- Addressing privacy concerns with OpenAI API usage

### User Experience
- Designing smooth interaction with the bot
- Determining intuitive commands and interfaces for developers

## Next Steps

1. Requirements Gathering
   - Define specific features and their scope
   - Identify primary use cases

2. Design Phase
   - Create detailed design document and architecture
   - Define data flow and main system components

3. Prototyping
   - Develop simple prototype of one feature (e.g., basic code review)
   - Test and iterate on the prototype

4. User Feedback
   - Gather feedback on the prototype
   - Refine design and requirements based on feedback

5. Incremental Development
   - Implement features one at a time with continuous testing
   - Reassess direction based on ongoing user feedback

6. Expand GitHub Integration
   - Implement more advanced GitHub operations (e.g., pull requests, code review automation)
   - Integrate GitHub operations with other bot features

## Immediate Action Items
- Create detailed requirements document
- Design high-level architecture of enhanced bot
- Decide on first feature to prototype (likely basic code review)
- Plan process for gathering and incorporating user feedback

## Next Decision
- Define specific requirements for code review and generation features
- OR
- Choose one feature to focus on initially
