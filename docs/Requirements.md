# ConsultAIng: Detailed Requirements Document

## 1. System Overview

ConsultAIng is an AI-powered Slack bot designed to assist software development teams with code review, code generation, and general programming queries. The bot integrates with Slack for communication and uses OpenAI's API for natural language processing and code analysis.

- FR1.1: The bot must respond to direct messages in Slack.
- FR1.2: The bot must respond when mentioned in public channels.
- FR1.3: The bot must support slash commands for specific actions.

### 2.2 Code Review

- FR2.1: Users must be able to submit code snippets for review.
- FR2.2: The bot must analyze submitted code for:
  - Style consistency
  - Potential bugs
  - Performance issues
  - Security vulnerabilities
- FR2.3: The bot must provide detailed, actionable feedback on the reviewed code.
- FR2.4: Users must be able to specify the programming language of the submitted code.

### 2.3 Code Generation

- FR3.1: Users must be able to request code generation with a natural language description.
- FR3.2: The bot must generate code snippets based on user requests.
- FR3.3: Generated code must adhere to specified or default style guidelines.
- FR3.4: The bot must provide explanations for the generated code.

### 2.4 Context Management

- FR4.1: Users must be able to set project-specific context (e.g., programming language, framework, coding standards).
- FR4.2: The bot must store and retrieve context information for different projects.
- FR4.3: Code review and generation must take into account the set context.

### 2.5 General Assistance

- FR5.1: The bot must answer general programming questions.
- FR5.2: The bot must provide explanations of programming concepts when asked.

## 3. Non-Functional Requirements

### 3.1 Performance

- NFR1.1: The bot must respond to user messages within 5 seconds.
- NFR1.2: Code review for snippets up to 200 lines must be completed within 30 seconds.
- NFR1.3: Code generation requests must be fulfilled within 15 seconds.

### 3.2 Scalability

- NFR2.1: The system must support up to 100 concurrent users.
- NFR2.2: The system must handle up to 1000 requests per hour.

### 3.3 Security

- NFR3.1: All communication between the bot and OpenAI's API must be encrypted.
- NFR3.2: User-submitted code must not be stored permanently.
- NFR3.3: The system must comply with GDPR for EU users.

### 3.4 Reliability

- NFR4.1: The bot must have an uptime of 99.9%.
- NFR4.2: The system must have error logging and monitoring.

### 3.5 Usability

- NFR5.1: The bot must use clear, concise language in its responses.
- NFR5.2: The bot must provide help documentation accessible through a slash command.

## 4. Constraints

- C1: The bot must be implemented using Python.
- C2: The bot must use the Slack Bolt SDK for Slack integration.
- C3: The bot must use OpenAI's GPT model for natural language processing and code analysis.

## 5. Future Considerations

- Integration with version control systems (e.g., GitHub, GitLab)
- Support for code refactoring suggestions
- Integration with project management tools
- Support for multiple natural languages

## 6. Acceptance Criteria

- AC1: Successfully pass all unit and integration tests.
- AC2: Receive positive feedback from a pilot group of at least 10 developers.
- AC3: Successfully handle edge cases, including malformed input and API failures.
- AC4: Meet all performance requirements under simulated load conditions.
- AC5: Pass a security audit, including penetration testing.

## 7. Glossary

- Bot: The ConsultAIng Slack application
- Snippet: A small section of code submitted for review or generated by the bot
- Context: Project-specific information that informs the bot's responses
- Slash Command: A Slack feature allowing users to trigger specific bot actions
